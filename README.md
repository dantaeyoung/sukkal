# Sukkal

_Sukkal (conventionally translated from Sumerian as "vizier") was a term which could denote both a type of official and a class of deities in ancient Mesopotamia. The historical sukkals were responsible for overseeing the execution of various commands of the kings and acted as diplomatic envoys and translators for foreign dignitaries._

Sukkal is an ongoing experiment in enabling you to talk to yourself.

By pressing and holding different keys on the keyboard, you can record audio notes, playback, and listen to yourself. An OpenAI api key allows for near-instant transcription of your conversation.

The intention of Sukkal is to enable 'parts work'-esque interlocution with one's self.
